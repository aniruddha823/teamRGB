# Team RGB
This project scrapes fundamentals data from Macrotrends.com to analyze the financial position of AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. It is written in Python through a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes BeautifulSoup & RegEx to find the relevant info scraped from the entirety of the requested pages. The motivation for this was to get a deeper look into the global computer chip shortage and gain a better understanding of finance/accounting principles. The Tableau dashboard that was created & used from this data can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aniruddha823/viz/TeamRGB/TeamRGBTiled

*Note: If it was not clear, here's the explanation for the name! Team Red/R = AMD, Team Green/G = Nvidia, Team Blue/B = Intel :)*
